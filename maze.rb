# Solve a real world problem using computer science data structures and algorithms
# Mazes

# Imagine a rectangular piece of graph paper. We could create a maze by coloring some of the lines to make walls. 

# We call that maze well-formed if it has exactly two exterior openings (an entrance and an exit), and exactly one path that connects the two openings. 

# 1. Design a data structure that can represent a rectangular maze. 
# 2. Create an algorithm that determines whether the maze is well-formed. 
# 3. Report the solution if the maze is well-formed.
